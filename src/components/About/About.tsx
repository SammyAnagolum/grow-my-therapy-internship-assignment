                            Finding time and opportunities to care for ourselves can be incredibly challenging in today's busy and demanding world. I believe therapy offers a dedicated space for self-care, providing the support and tools needed to improve this essential practice. Therapy can help individuals identify and clarify their goals, values, and the various elements that contribute to their well-being, recognizing that these aspects vary from person to person. </p>

                            I am dedicated to supporting this journey by offering active listening, psychological knowledge, empathy, compassion, and insights into behavioral patterns and tendencies. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Clinical Psychology from the Michigan School of Psychology (2012) and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Western Michigan University (2018). My experience spans therapy and psychological assessment in psychiatric inpatient units, academic medical centers, universities, and outpatient practice settings. </p>
                        <p className="leading-loose text-lg font-freight-sans-pro">
                            My therapeutic approach is primarily psychodynamic and humanistic, enriched by influences from positive psychology, existentialism, family systems theory, acceptance and commitment concepts, and mindfulness practices.
